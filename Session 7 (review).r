# Instructions 
#=============
# An RData file has been prepared for you. The file consists of data you already know, the realestate data, and a new data frame, credit. 
# Answer each one of the questions assigned to your group *on your own* -- a total of three questions. You have 1.25 hour. 
# Discuss your solutions as a group. You have 0.5 hour, including a 10 min. break. 
# Present solutions to class. Discuss issues/concerns. Each group gets 15 min.  

# Tips: 
# Make sure to properly allocate time! Start by exploring the new data frame and consider how to best answer these questions. 

#take a look at data #data types #convert #use gsub #at least say there is a limit to ur analysis #missing data odd symbols odd values
#univariate analysis #bivariate analysis #plotting testing

# Group I 
#========

# realestate data 
#=
# Is there a difference in the distribution of air conditioning by bedrooms as a factor? Use relevant statistics, plots and statistical tests. For your plots, use at least one ggplot (properly titled, annotated, and visually reasonable). Detail your findings.

# Common question: Which variables in the data in your view exhibit the strongest relationship with price? Provide evidence and explain your answer. 

# credit data 
#=
# *Throughly* examine the relationships of Income, Balance, Age, Gender, Ethnicity (all of these are potential IVS), with Rating (our DV). Which of these IVs are good predictors? Use statistics, plots, and tests, and provide a detailed answer.

# Group II
